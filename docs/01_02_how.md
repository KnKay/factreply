# How can we get faster

I heared many opinions where discussions get ruled by the worst person in the room, as facts doesn't matter. This was a plus, as you can say things and this is just not the point if there is a fact behind it. Seeing this more and more going into SoMe (or be based there what the hell...).
But as a keyboard warrior you have more time. For me the research is sometimes very a down turner. To prevent this I guess a comunity of like minded can store and use facts a bit faster and better. Using this is some keywords and even a link (to prove it's truth) we can just fire it up. 

## We need a pool of reply facts
We need a ppol of facts to reply. This should ideally be not a problem. We know more or less outr facts. Can save them and add keywords. As a bonus as w group of users we can use the same terminology, keep the facts update and well organized. 

## We may even want more
We may even want to give hints to a direction that is "beyond" of our facts. Some people tend to go the easy way, as they know it. If we have some good ideas and visions that may make a difference. At least this may help to mak a good complete picture.
