# Tech stack

* As we may not want to have a web server (with database) be up and runnng 24/7 we should have a desktop app (or something like this).
* We may later on wnat to deply it to a web/nas/wtf
* We should have a pool that is shared in more or less real time
* we should enable non tech persons to update
* We may not want to be bound to a specific provider
