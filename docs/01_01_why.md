# Help social media activists to find a quick reply

Heading to the german election fake news may spread. To have a quick fact on hand in social media works this can help.
The idea is to keep a bit of fact research away from tha daily work on comments etc..

This can also be extended to a reply with a good perspective. Like good news this may help some one a bit to get on the side we like.
